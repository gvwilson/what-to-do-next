<div class="scenario" markdown="1">

You are co-teaching a workshop at a conference with a senior (relatively
famous) data scientist you have never met in person before. After an
hour, you notice that they only ever ask male students to share their
work with the class. You have pointed this out as gently as you can and
they have become very defensive. What are the next steps you would take,
assuming that each step makes them even more defensive or argumentative?
