<div class="scenario" markdown="1">

A senior professor in your department wants to give this question to an
undergraduate statistics class to prompt discussion of bias:

> People of East Asian or South Asian ancestry make up 8% of the Canadian population,
> but 60–75% of undergraduates in Computer Science at major Canadian universities.
>
> 1. Write two one-page papers to argue pro and con that this proves people of non-Asian ancestry
>    are intrinsically less capable of abstract reasoning than people of Asian descent.
>
> 2. Compare and contrast your arguments with those made about
>    the underrepresentation of women in computing and data science being due to aptitude and/or interest.
