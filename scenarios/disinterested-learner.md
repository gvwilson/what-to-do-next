<div class="scenario" markdown="1">

You have been sent to a company to deliver a week-long introduction to R
and the tidyverse to a team of 8 statisticians who have been using SAS
for many years. Most of them seem interested, but one is obviously not:
they are answering email during lessons, not bothering to do exercises,
shrugging off questions, etc.

You spoke with them at the end of the first day to say that their
behavior is demotivating other learners. After telling you that they
don't think the class is worthwhile---they can do everything they need
to in SAS and they don't see why the company is forcing them to
switch---they promised to do better. However, it is now mid-morning on
day 2 and if anything their behavior is worse.
